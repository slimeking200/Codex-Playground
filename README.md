# Azure Depths – 3D Fishing Adventure

Azure Depths is an expansive Three.js-powered fishing simulation packed with reactive weather systems, procedurally generated islands, and a rich codex of legendary species. Sail a stylized catamaran, hunt for sonar pings, and complete quest contracts to master every biome.

## Features

- **Cinematic world building** – dynamic day/night lighting, shader-driven water, volumetric skydome, and weather transitions from calm mornings to electric storms.
- **Deep progression systems** – level up mastery, manage lure inventory, unlock new biomes, and chase multi-stage questlines.
- **Living ecosystem** – dozens of fish archetypes with bespoke behaviors, schooling instincts, and respawn timers that keep the world active.
- **Diegetic UI** – holographic HUD, codex menus, expedition journal, tutorial briefings, and animated catch feed.
- **Immersive ambience** – adaptive audio beds and tactile feedback such as sonar rings, water ripples, and reactive sails.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed development URL in your browser to explore the world. Use **WASD** to steer, scroll to zoom, click to cast, and **Esc** to open the codex for lure swaps.

To produce an optimized build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled assets will land in the `dist/` directory ready for static hosting.
